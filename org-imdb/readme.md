# Org Imdb

## Intro
Org Imdb is a package which very easily let's you add movies to your personal
org-mode watchlist. This package started of as an experiment for me to learn
webscraping with elisp. I started of by capturing an Imdb movie link, parsing
some of the data, and adding that to an org-mode document. Then I started
wondering if it would be possible to just enter the title of the movie or
series. If there was more than one result, just ask the user to choose the right
one from within emacs. I decided to record a little gif, and people seemed to
like it. And that's where we are now. I'm not an expert in Lisp (let alone
Elisp), so please send me your pull requests! I'm always open to learning better
code practice.
